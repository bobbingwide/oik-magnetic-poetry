== Description ==
Magnetic Poetry block for the WordPress Block Editor.

A Server Side Rendered WordPress block that makes your poem look like poetry written using fridge magnets.

It doesn't have to be a poem.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the oik-magnetic-poetry plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What if I leave the block blank? =
If you don't write anything, and Hello Dolly is activated, then you'll see a randomly selected line from the song.

= What if Hello Dolly is not activated? =
If it's not activated then it'll be "Code is Poetry".
No surprises there.

= It sometimes looks a bit funny =
Yes. It needs some better CSS

= Can I choose the font size and amount each word is rotated? =
Not using the block's settings.
But you can write some custom CSS.
